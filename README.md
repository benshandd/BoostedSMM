# BoostedSMM

[BoostedSMM](https://boostedsmm.com/) is a cutting-edge social media marketing platform designed to help individuals and businesses achieve their online marketing goals with ease.

## Description

As a second year SWEN student at Victoria University of Wellington, I am excited to showcase this project that I have been working on since November 2022.

BoostedSMM is a result of my passion for Software Engineering and Business. The website features a clean and modern design that is fully automated, allowing for a seamless user experience. Our platform offers a range of social media marketing services that are tailored to suit the unique needs of our clients.

One of the key features that I'm proud to have implemented in BoostedSMM is the ability to accept payments through multiple gateways. By integrating Coinbase, Stripe, and Paypal APIs, our platform enables clients to choose the payment method that suits them best, ensuring a hassle-free experience.
